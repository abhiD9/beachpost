    Google Login O-Auth
    Redux - globalstate management

Please Note: I have used react-filebase64 for image conversion in this project 
But it will surely fill our database particularly -> documents (as they can be of just 16mb at max)
This is a demo project which is deployed on heroku (backend) where we have limited space, but in production builds we must use backend, multer or any other package for image uploads on the server in respective folders not inside the mongoDB's document.
